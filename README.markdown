# Pure CSS Blockquotes

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/killshot13/pen/MWJeOwE](https://codepen.io/killshot13/pen/MWJeOwE).

Developed using only CSS and HTML, these blockquotes examples offer a nice way to show off your site's accent color(s) without much extra work. 

By using the natural breakpoints in  `border` and changing the `width` of the "negative space", I was able to create two nice angled versions. 

This is made possible by giving `border-bottom` and `border-top` the exact same color as `background-color`, creating a simulated angle that would otherwise be hard to achieve on such a narrow width.

I'm sure I cannot be the only one to have thought of this idea, but I have not yet come across it so I am quite proud to take credit for this version of the concept at least.

Of course, anyone is free to use it or find ways to improve it. Just put a link back in the comments please!
