		<blockquote class="blkquote-smooth" cite="https://codepen.io/killshot13/pen/MWJeOwE">
			<p>Developed using only CSS and HTML, these blockquotes examples offer a nice way to show off your site's accent color(s) without much extra work.</p>
			<p>By using the natural breakpoints in <code>border</code> and changing the <code>width</code> of the "negative space" if you will, I was able to create two nice angled versions.</p>
			<p>This is made possible by giving <code>border-bottom</code> and <code>border-top</code> the exact same color as <code>background-color</code>, creating a simulated angle that would otherwise be hard to achieve on such a narrow width.</p>
